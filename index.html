            <p>
                Another trend that has continued to dominate this year has been pastel tones. These sorbet-inspired
                colors are the perfect option for summer and they suit a wide variety of skin tones. Choose from a
                boiler suit in cool mint green or an oversized trench coat in soft lavender ‚Äì better yet, try them both
                simultaneously. Suits and separates in the soft and buttery hues elevate your overall aesthetic and will
                remain one of the chicest styles for seasons to come.

                a silky design with floral motifs or intricate patterns, or keep it simple with bold colors and block
                letters. When styling this accessory, you can wrap the fabric under your chin in a loose knot, or have
                it hanging off the back of your head ‚Äì mix things up by wrapping it around your neck or let it dangle
                from your bag. Channeling your inner Grace Kelly has never been easier with this classic go-to item.
